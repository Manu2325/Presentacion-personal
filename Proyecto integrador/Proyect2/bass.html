        <h3>History</h3>
            <div class="p-textos">
                <P>The history of the bass dates back to the early 20th century when there was a need for an instrument 
                    that could provide a more prominent bass sound in jazz bands and popular music of the time. The electric 
                    bass guitar as we know it today was invented by Leo Fender in the 1950s. His most famous model, the Fender 
                    Precision Bass, introduced in 1951, revolutionized modern music by providing a deep, powerful sound that 
                    could be easily amplified. Since then, the bass guitar has been a fundamental element in a wide variety of 
                    musical genres, from jazz and funk to rock and pop. Its role in music is to provide the bassline, 
                    which sets the rhythm and harmony of a song, along with the drums.</P>

        <h3>Types</h3>
            <div class="p-textos">
                <p>The bass guitar is a string instrument similar to the guitar, but with a lower range, usually featuring 
                    four strings tuned to E, A, D, and G, although there are also five and six-string basses. The main types of 
                    bass guitars include:</p>
            </div>
                <img src="Assest/images/Normalbass2.jpg" alt="Normalbass2" width="800" height="500">
            <div class="p-textos">
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Electric Bass:</strong> This is the most common type of bass, with a solid body similar 
                        to an electric guitar and magnetic pickups to amplify the sound.</p></li>
                        <img src="Assest/images/bassamp.jpg" alt="bassamp" width="800" height="800">

                    <li><p><strong>Acoustic Bass:</strong> It has a larger, hollow body that produces a more resonant and natural 
                        sound without the need for electric amplification.</p></li>
                        <img src="Assest/images/bajosacusticos.jpg" alt="bajosacusticos">
                    
                    <li><p><strong>Fretted and Fretless Bass:</strong> Fretted basses have metal bars embedded in the fretboard 
                        to mark the notes, while fretless basses do not have these bars, allowing for smoother tones and 
                        easier sliding between notes.</p></li>
                        <img src="Assest/images/bajosintraste.jpg" alt="bajosintraste">

                    <li><p><strong>Five-String Bass:</strong> A five-string bass typically adds a low B string below the standard EADG tuning. 
                        This extra string provides a deeper, more resonant low end, giving bassists access to lower notes without needing 
                        to downtune the instrument. It's commonly used in genres like metal, jazz, and fusion, where extended range and 
                        versatility are valued.</p></li>
                        <img src="Assest/images/5strings.jfif" alt="5-String" width="800" height="500" href="Charles Jimenez Photografy">

                    <li><p><strong>Six-String Bass:</strong> A six-string bass adds both a low B string and a high C string to the standard EADG tuning. 
                        This configuration expands the instrument's range in both directions, allowing bassists to play higher melodies or chords as well  
                        as deeper basslines. Six-string basses are less common than five-string basses and are often used by bassists seeking even greater 
                        versatility and expressiveness in their playing.</p></li>
